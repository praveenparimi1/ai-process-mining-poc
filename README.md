# 🤖 AI/ML Process Mining – Proof of Concept (Nationwide Mutual Insurance)

## 📌 Project Overview

At **Nationwide Mutual Insurance**, I led an AI/ML-driven Process Mining Proof-of-Concept (POC) as part of a broader CRM and BPM modernization initiative. This POC marked the **first successful integration between IBM BPM and IBM MDM platforms**, laying the groundwork for architectural validation and data consistency across business units.

The analysis involved mining workflows from legacy CRM systems, identifying inefficiencies, and creating data-backed automation strategies using predictive models. This foundational work **enabled the broader project to move forward** and also supported IBM in leveraging the findings to **pursue patent filings** related to BPM–MDM orchestration and metadata handling.

## 🧩 Key Responsibilities
- Conducted process mining using Blueworks Live across multi-channel CRM workflows
- Designed As-Is and To-Be flows backed by performance KPIs
- Created lightweight predictive models based on historical delay patterns
- Built a business case for automation based on cycle-time and effort variance

## 🚀 Achievements
- ⏱️ Reduced cycle-time by 15% in pilot areas
- 📊 Increased process visibility and stakeholder alignment
- 🤖 Identified automation opportunities and bottlenecks
- 🧠 Supported IBM with input for patent-related documentation

## 🛠️ Tools Used
`Blueworks Live`, `BPMN`, `MS Visio`, `Excel`, `Python (analytics prototype)`, `Tableau`, `Rational`, `POC Slides`

## 📁 Files Included
- 🧭 As-Is / To-Be Process Maps (sanitized)
- 📄 Presentation Slides (Executive Summary)
- 🔄 Workflow Diagrams (BPMN/UML-style)
