# 🤖 AI/ML Process Mining – Proof of Concept (Nationwide Mutual Insurance)

## 📌 Project Overview

At **Nationwide Mutual Insurance**, I led an AI/ML-driven Process Mining Proof-of-Concept (POC) as part of a broader CRM and BPM modernization initiative. This POC marked the **first successful integration between IBM BPM and IBM MDM platforms**, laying the groundwork for architectural validation and data consistency across business units.

The analysis involved mining workflows from legacy CRM systems, identifying inefficiencies, and creating data-backed automation strategies using predictive models. This foundational work **enabled the broader project to move forward** and also supported IBM in leveraging the findings to **pursue patent filings** related to BPM–MDM orchestration and metadata handling.

## 🧩 Key Responsibilities
- Conducted end-to-end process mining using **Blueworks Live** across multiple customer support workflows
- Exported As-Is process maps and identified high-latency areas and redundancy points
- Created To-Be models based on optimization scenarios, supported by KPI thresholds
- Designed a **lightweight predictive logic model** using historical cycle time data to flag potential delays
- Delivered **executive dashboards** visualizing risk areas, opportunity size, and time-saving projections

## 🚀 Achievements
- ⏱️ Reduced cycle-time by 15% in pilot business units (claims + support)
- 🔄 Identified 7+ automation opportunities with clear ROI estimates
- 📊 Increased visibility of end-to-end process metrics for stakeholders
- 🤖 Positioned POC to scale into a broader automation and CRM transformation roadmap

## 🛠️ Tools Used
`Blueworks Live`, `BPMN`, `MS Visio`, `Excel`, `Python (analytics prototype)`, `Tableau`, `Rational`, `POC Slides`

## 📁 Files Included
- 🧭 As-Is / To-Be Process Maps (sanitized)
- 📄 Presentation Slides (Executive Summary)
- 🔄 Workflow Diagrams (BPMN/UML-style)
